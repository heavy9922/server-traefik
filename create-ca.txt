Configure Debian Server as CA with OpenSSL

# Install OpenSSL package (if not installed)

apt-get -y install openssl

# Create a private key for yor CA

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096

; Enter Passphrase for decrypting the key

# (optional) Setup permissions for the key in order to prevent unauthorized access

chmod 700 ca.key

# Create the CA certificate, Using the previously created key

openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

; You will be prompted for parameters for the certificate

# At this point, we have configured our CA and we can start creating certificates from this.

#Creating a Certificate from CA

# Create private key

openssl genrsa -aes256 -out web.key 1024

# Create certificate request

openssl req -new -days 365 -key web.key -out web.csr

# Sign certificate with your CA certificate

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in web.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out web.crt

# Your Certificate is already signed by yor CA and can be used for securing services

# You can remove the password from the key by using

openssl rsa -in web.key -out web.key

# create a file named san.cnf that will have the following settings

[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
C = CO
ST = Bogota
L = Bogota
O = inlaze
OU = inlaze
CN = inlazetest.com

[v3_req]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = inlazetest.com
DNS.2 = *.inlazetest.com


# assign read permission to the created file

chmod 644 san.cnf


# Generate CSR with configuration file

openssl req -new -key web.key -out web.csr -config san.cnf


# Sign the CSR to generate the certificate:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in web.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out web.crt -extensions v3_req -extfile san.cnf

# Verify the generated certificate:

openssl x509 -in web.crt -text -noout | grep -E "CN|DNS"

# Remove the passphrase from the private certificate

openssl rsa -in web.key -out web.key

chmod 600 web.key
